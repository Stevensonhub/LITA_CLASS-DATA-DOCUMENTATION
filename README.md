# LITA_CLASS-DATA-DOCUMENTATION
 I am currently training with The incubator hub as a Data Analyst, and this is where i would be documenting my first project. My proficiency in data preparation, validation, manipulation, analysis, and visualisation has improved significantly as a result of this experience. I am developing my capacity to extract meaning patterns for business decisions by working on practical projects that provide me with a greater understanding of data-driven decision making processes.
